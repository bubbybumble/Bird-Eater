# Bird Eater

This project was made by Aiden James and Jacob Wieland (https://github.com/SnakeEyes0723) for the UNCC 49 hour game jam. I decided to upload it here to show this project.

## Tools

Bird Eater is written in C# in the Godot game engine. Most of the programming was done by me, while art was handled by Jake using Aseprite. I also wrote the music and sound effects for the game in Tracktion Waveform.

## Notes

The game is fairly straigtforward seeing as we only had 2 days to make it. Despite having one of the simplest games in the jam, it was a strength of the project as it allowed us to have one of the more polished projects.

The game can be found at https://bubbybumble.itch.io/bird-eater-2022

For whatever reason, Godot lags whenever particles first appear. The first bird you eat causes a short stutter in the gameplay. In later projects I have to create every particle effect in the game upon scene startup to mitigate this seemingly unresolvable bug.
