# Bird Eater

This project was made by Aiden James and Jacob Wieland for the UNCC 49 hour game jam. I decided to upload it here to show this project.

## Creation

Bird Eater is written in C# in the Godot game engine. Most of the programming was done by me, while art was handled by Jake. The game is fairly straigtforward seeing as we only had 2 days to make it.
